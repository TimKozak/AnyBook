"'FABLES,' by Robert Louis Stevenson. Holograph. First published in Longmans's Magazine, Aug. and Sept. 1895, Vol. 26, pp. 362, 472; afterwards appended to a new edition of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Longmans, Green, and Co, 1896) with an introduction by Sir Sidney Colvin. The first separate edition was publislied in 1902. Two of the fables, 'The Cart-Horse and the Saddle-Horse' and 'The Tadpole and the Frog,' appear to have been printed from the corrected pencil versions on f. 22 b, in preference to those in ink on ff. 23, 24. Only pencil versions exist of 'The Penitent,' here with no title, f. 22; 'The Four Reformers,' f. 22; 'The Reader,' f. 20; and 'The Citizen and the Traveller,' f. 22. The moral to 'The Man and his Friend,' f. 19, is omitted in the published editions. On f. 1 is a list of sixteen titles, six of which differ from the printed work, as does the order; the list is headed 'Aesop in the Fog,' over a cancelled heading, 'The Fabulist.' Drafts of some verses occur on f. 1 b : and on f. 20 b are the address of an English chemist at Hyères and some scribblings relating to music editions. Paper; ff. 49. Folio and quarto.
